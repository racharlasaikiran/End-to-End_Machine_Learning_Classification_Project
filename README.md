# loan_approval_prediction_project
A machine learning–based Loan Approval Prediction System built using Python to classify whether a loan application is Approved or Rejected based on applicant demographics, financial history, and credit profile.
This project covers the complete ML pipeline including data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, ANN and deployment-ready structure.

### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build and compare multiple classification models to identify the best-performing algorithm for predicting loan approval status. The system evaluates each model using standard classification metrics and compares their performance.

### Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow / Keras, Jupyter Notebook.
