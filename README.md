# End-to-End-Classification-Project
A Machine Learning–based Classification Analysis Project built using Python. This project implements multiple classification algorithms to predict discrete class labels. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and compare multiple classification models to identify the best-performing algorithm for predicting the target class. The system evaluates each model using standard classification metrics and compares their performance.

### Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow / Keras, Jupyter Notebook.

### Approach
- Data Preprocessing:- Loaded dataset using Pandas, Renamed inconsistent columns, Removed unnecessary columns, Treated outliers, Applied feature scaling, Performed train–test split.

 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):- Analyzed feature distributions, Studied correlation between variables, Identified multicollinearity, Visualized important patterns and trends.

- Feature Engineering:- Selected important features, Converted categorical data into numerical format, Prepared final feature matrix for modeling.

- Classification Models Implemented:- Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

🔹 Model Evaluation

Each model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy Score

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix
